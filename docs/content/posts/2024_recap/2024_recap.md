As 2024 ends, I find myself reflecting on a year full of collaboration, learning, and meaningful contributions. Here's what made this year special:

### Google Summer of Code and Beyond üöÄ
I feel lucky to have worked with amazing people from [ML4SCI](https://ml4sci.org/) during and after Google Summer of Code. We have a few papers at our hand üìö:

- Quantum Vision Transformers for Quark‚ÄìGluon Classification {{<cite "qvision">}}.
- ‚Ñ§‚ÇÇ √ó ‚Ñ§‚ÇÇ Equivariant Quantum Neural Networks: Benchmarking Against Classical Neural Networks {{<cite "dong2024z2">}}.
- Hybrid Quantum Vision Transformers for Event Classification in High Energy Physics {{<cite "unlu2024hybrid">}}.
- A Comparison Between Invariant and Equivariant Classical and Quantum Graph Neural Networks {{<cite "forestano2024comparison">}}.

Co-authoring them reminded me how teamwork and shared interest can push quantum and classical machine learning forward. I am grateful to my mentors and collaborators for their guidance and support.

### Mentoring @ ML4SCI, Google Summer of Code üåü
Being a mentor this year was an enriching experience. For someone who codes a lot, it was valuable to experience to guide new contributors in this field. It made me feel humble and inspired. Thank you to the amazing mentees for putting in so much effort üí™:

- [Rey Guadarrama](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reyguadarrama/): QGAN for Monte Carlo Simulations {{<cite "guadarrama2024quantum">}}.
- [Masha Baidachna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/masha-baidachna-77a260247/): Quantum Diffusion Model for HEP {{<cite "baidachna2024quantum">}}.
- [Alessandro Tesi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandro-tesi-18b588291/): Quantum Transformer for HEP Analysis {{<cite "qattention">}}.
- [Sanya Nanda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanya-nanda-aba12218b/): Learning Quantum Representations of Classical HEP Data with Contrastive Learning.
- [Adithya Penagonda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adithyapenagonda/): QGAN for HEP Analysis at LHC.

I appreciate ML4SCI, especially [Prof. Sergei Gleyzer](http://sergeigleyzer.com/) for this opportunity.

### My First Quantum Role: Thank You, Qkrishi üéâ

Joining [Qkrishi](http://sergeigleyzer.com/) as a Research Software Engineer shaped a key part of 2024. I explored how quantum computing can be used in the financial industry while collaborating with experts in the field. Highlights include:

- Implemented quantum algorithms for portfolio optimization and fraud detection at utility scale.
- Developed a proof of concept with the third largest private sector bank in India {{<cite "qkrishi">}}.
- Represented our work on portfolio optimization at eOTF TechFest 2024.

Thank you to the Qkrishi team for making my first full-time quantum role so fulfilling!

### EPFL: Where the Magic Happens ‚ú®
This year also marked the beginning of my journey at EPFL in the Master's program in Quantum Science and Engineering. So far, I got a chance to work on my first-semester project, *Quantum Natural Gradient in Superoperator Formalism*, with the Quantum Information and Computing (QIC) group under [Prof. Zo√´ Holmes](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/qic/prof-zoe-holmes/) and guided by [Tyson Jones](https://tysonjones.io/index.html).

The project focused on extending Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) to noisy quantum circuits using Superoperator Formalism, allowing simulations of noisy circuits in the statevector picture (More details coming soon).

I‚Äôm excited about the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead at EPFL!

### Achievements to Celebrate üèÜ
- [IBM Quantum Challenge 2024 Achievement](https://www.credly.com/badges/7f45eb47-6aa3-4edd-8fb5-d248a621c05f/public_url).
- Unitary Hack: [Resolved 5 issues across 4 projects](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wtRuK3T6rmntTSga3ZJ8DxnxXNb7unyL/view), ranking in the top 10 out of 68 hackers.
- QHack 2024: [First Place Prize](https://pennylane.ai/blog/2024/03/qhack-2024-highlights#top-teams-and-projects) for my project "Simulating lithium-ion batteries on quantum computers," awarded by NVIDIA & Denver Dataworks. Placed in the [top 100](https://pennylane.ai/profile/gopald?certificate=qhack-2024-coding-challenges-top-100) teams in the Quantum Coding Challenge Competition.
- PennyLane: [Certificate of Achievement](https://pennylane.ai/profile/gopald?certificate=introduction-to-pennylane) for proficiency in the basics of PennyLane.

### Closing Thoughts üåà

2024 has helped me grow, both professionally and personally. I‚Äôm truly grateful to my mentors, collaborators, and teams who made these accomplishments possible. A special thanks to [Prof. Dhiman Saha](https://www.iitbhilai.ac.in/index.php?pid=dhiman), who introduced me to quantum computing through his course Quantum Symmetric-Key Cryptanalysis at IIT Bhilai. His passion for learning and teaching continues to inspire me. As I move into 2025, I carry with me the lessons learned, the relationships, and a fresh drive to push quantum computing forward.

Here's to staying curious, working together, and making a difference! üí´
