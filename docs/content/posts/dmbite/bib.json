    "abstract": "We introduce a method to perform imaginary time evolution in a controllable quantum system using measurements and conditional unitary operations. By performing a sequence of weak measurements based on the desired Hamiltonian constructed by a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition, an evolution approximating imaginary time evolution can be realized. The randomness due to measurement is corrected using conditional unitary operations, making the evolution deterministic. Both the measurements required for the algorithm and the conditional unitary operations can be constructed efficiently. We estimate the complexity of the whole algorithm to scale as the inverse gap squared of the energy gap for a spectrum with uniform density of states.",
