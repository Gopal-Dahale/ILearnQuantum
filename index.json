[{"content":"A Womanium Global Media Project Initiative.\nCollisions in hash functions A collision in a hash function is when two different inputs produce the same output hash. This is a problem because it violates the fundamental premise of a hash function, which is to produce a unique output for each unique input. Collisions can be exploited by attackers to create fraudulent transactions or gain unauthorized access to secure systems, making them a critical concern in the design and implementation of hash functions.\nTo avoid collisions, hash functions use complex mathematical algorithms to ensure that each input produces a unique output. The quality of a hash function is typically measured by its collision resistance, which refers to its ability to prevent collisions from occurring. Strong collision resistance is important for the security of systems that rely on hash functions, such as digital signatures and cryptographic hash functions used in encryption.\nThe BHT Algorithm The BHT algorithm ( Citation: Brassard,\u0026#32;Hoyer \u0026amp; al.,\u0026#32; Brassard,\u0026#32; G.,\u0026#32; Hoyer,\u0026#32; P.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Tapp,\u0026#32; A. \u0026#32; (n.d.). \u0026#32; Quantum Algorithm for the Collision Problem. ) is a generic quantum collision-finding algorithm developed by Brassard, HÃ¸yer, and Tapp. The goal is to find a collision of a random function $F : \\{ 0, 1 \\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}^n$.\nGrover\u0026rsquo;s Algorithm and Generalization Given a function $F: X \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$ such that there exists a unique $x_0 \\in X$ so that $F(x_0) = 1$. The task is to find $x_0$. We know that this requires $O(\\sqrt{N})$ evaluations of $F$ where, $N = |X|$ ( Citation: Grover,\u0026#32; Grover,\u0026#32; L. \u0026#32; (n.d.). \u0026#32; A fast quantum mechanical algorithm for database search. ) .\nTo generalize this, consider an arbitrary function $F: X \\rightarrow Y$. Now, given some $y_0 \\in Y$, find $x \\in X$ such that $F(x) = y_0$ provided such $x$ exists. If there are $t$ number of solutions i.e. there are $t$ number of such $x$, then it requires $O(\\sqrt{N/t})$ evaluations of $F$. From now onwards, we denote this generalization by Grover($F, y_0$). This will be handy later.\nWhat is qRAM? qRAM is a quantum analogue of RAM which allows to efficiently access stored data in quantum superpositions.\nLet there be a list of classical data $L = \\{ x_0, x_1 \\dots x_{2^m -1} \\}$ where $x_i\\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ for each $i$. Then, the qRAM for $L$ is modeled as an unitary operator $U_{\\text{qRAM}}(L)$ defined by\n$$ \\begin{equation} U_{\\text{qRAM}}(L): \\ket{i} \\otimes \\ket{y} \\rightarrow \\ket{i} \\otimes \\ket{y \\oplus x_i} \\end{equation} $$\nfor $i\\in \\{0,1\\}^m$ and $y\\in \\{0,1\\}^n $.\nIn this context, having qRAM available means that we have a quantum gate capable of realizing the unitary operation (1) for a list $L$ of classical data in addition to access to basic quantum gates ( Citation: Hosoyamada\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Sasaki,\u0026#32; Hosoyamada,\u0026#32; A.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Sasaki,\u0026#32; Y. \u0026#32; (n.d.). \u0026#32; Finding Hash Collisions with Quantum Computers by Using Differential Trails with Smaller Probability than Birthday Bound. ) .\nBHT Algorithm The algorithm consists of 2 steps\nStep 1\nStart by selecting an arbitrary subset $K \\subseteq X$ of cardinality $k = 2^{n/3}$. Create a table $L$ where each item in $L$ holds a unique pair $(x, F (x))$ with $x \\in K$. Sort $L$ according to the second entry in each item of $L$. Verify whether $L$ contains any collisions, meaning check if there are distinct elements $(x_0, F (x_0)), (x_1, F (x_1)) \\in L$ such that $F (x_0) = F (x_1)$. If so, proceed to Step 2.3. If not, the $2^{n/3}$ pairs of $L$ are stored in qRAM. The implication is that they can be accessed in quantum superposition. Step 2\nCalculate $x_1 = \\textbf{Grover}(H, 1)$ where $H : X \\rightarrow {0, 1}$ denotes the function defined by $H(x) = 1$ iff there exists $x_0 \\in K$ such that $(x_0 , F (x)) \\in L$ but $x \\not = x_0$. (It\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that if such $x_0$ exists, it is unique, as we have already verified the absence of collisions in $L$). Search $(x_0 , F (x_1 )) \\in L$. Output the collision set ${x_0 , x_1 }$. Collision Complexity For the BHT algorithm, the step 1 involves making queries in time $O(2^{n/3})$. Step 2 uses Grover\u0026rsquo;s search and runs in $O\\left(\\sqrt{2^n/|L|}\\right) = O(2^{n/3})$. Therefore, BHT finds a collision in time $\\tilde{O}(2^{n/3})$ by making $O(2^{n/3})$ quantum queries, provided that there is access to exponentially large quantum random access memory (qRAM).\nClassical Setting In the classical setting, the generic attack complexity to find collisions against an n-bit hash function is $O(2^{n/2})$ due to the birthday paradox. As a result, any dedicated attack that finds collisions with less than $O(2^{n/2})$ complexity is considered as a meaningful attack.\nQuantum Setting In the quantum setting, the complexity of a generic attack depends on the specific assumptions or model of the underlying quantum machines. Regardless of the model, the lower bound of the query complexity is proven to be $\\Omega(2^{n/3})$ ( Citation: Zhandry,\u0026#32; Zhandry,\u0026#32; M. \u0026#32; (n.d.). \u0026#32; A Note on the Quantum Collision and Set Equality Problems. ) and there is an attack matching this bound if $O(2^{n/3})$ qubits are available which is the BHT algorithm. By the same analogy, any dedicated attack with less than $O(2^{n/3})$ quantum complexity should be regarded as a meaningful attack. However, comparing dedicated attacks with the generic attack complexity in the quantum setting requires careful consideration because the generic attack complexity depends on the model of the quantum computations. We\u0026rsquo;ll see this in the next sections.\nImpact of qRAM on BHT We consider a model of a small quantum computer of polynomial size and a qRAM that allows us to access exponentially many classical data in quantum superposition. Here we do $\\textbf{not}$ consider any parallelized computations. In this model, the best collision-finding algorithm is BHT because we can implement it with qRAM (of size $O(2^{n/3})$) and its time complexity matches the tight quantum query complexity $\\Theta (2^{n/3} )$.\nTime and memory tradeoff compared to classical algorithms BHT achieves a time complexity $\\tilde{O}(2^{n/3})$, however, it requires a large qRAM of size $\\tilde{O}(2^{n/3} )$ as well. This raises concerns since the availability of such qRAM in the future is uncertain, especially in the case of small quantum computers.\nAlternatively, one can use a quantum circuit of size $O(2^{n/3})$, but it comes with the trade-off of using an exponentially large number of qubits. This leads to questions about parallelization. In terms of time-space complexity, BHT is less efficient than the classical parallel rho method ( Citation: Bernstein,\u0026#32; Bernstein,\u0026#32; D. \u0026#32; (n.d.). \u0026#32; Cost analysis of hash collisions: Will quantum computers make SHARCS obsolete. ) ( Citation: Oorschot\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Wiener,\u0026#32; Oorschot,\u0026#32; P.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Wiener,\u0026#32; M. \u0026#32; (n.d.). \u0026#32; Parallel collision search with application to hash functions and discrete logarithms. ) . When $P$ classical processors are available, the parallel rho method finds a collision in time $O(2^{n/2}/P)$. This means that if a quantum computer of size $2^{n/3}$ is available, but qRAM is not, simply running the parallel rho method on the quantum computer can find a collision in time $2^{n/6}$ which is much faster than BHT.\nIn the classical setting, the rho method finds a memory-less collision in time $O(2^{n/2})$, which matches the classical tight bound for query complexity. However, there is no known any $\\textbf{memory-less}$ quantum collision finding algorithm that matches the optimal query complexity $2^{n/3}$.\nLet $S$ denote the size of computational resources required for a quantum algoithm and $S$ is the maximum size of quantum computers and classical memory. Let $T$ denote its time complexity. Then the trade-off $T \\cdot S = 2^{n/2}$ given by the parallel rho method is the best one even in the quantum setting.\nOutlook In the quantum setting, comparing dedicated attacks with the generic attack complexity requires caution since the generic attack complexity depends on the model of the quantum computations. As we have seen, the BHT cannot outperform the classical computations, considering that each qubit can behave as either processor or memory (by running $2^{n/3}$ processors in parallel, collisions can be found in time $O(2^{n/6})$ even with classical machines). However, if a quantum computer of polynomial size with exponentially large qRAM is available, BHT is the best collision attack. It is challenging to predict which model is more likely to be realized in the future, and it would be valuable to discuss the advantages of attacks in various models with different generic attack complexities.\nReferences Bernstein (n.d.)

To understand this, let us consider the time-dependent Schrodinger equation for a system with Hamiltonian $H$:\n$$ \\begin{equation} i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\ket{\\psi(t)}= H \\ket{\\psi(t)} \\end{equation} $$\nwhere $ \\ket{\\psi(t)} $ is is the state of the system at time $t$, and $H$ is the Hamiltonian of the system. In the case of real time evolutoin, the state of the system at time $t$ is given by $ \\ket{\\psi(t)} = e^{-iHt}\\ket{\\psi(0)}$ where $\\ket{\\psi(0)}$ is the initial state of the system.\nIn the case of imaginary time evolution, the modified Schrodinger equation is given by:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau}\\ket{\\psi(\\tau)} = -H\\ket{\\psi(\\tau)} $$\nThe solution to this equation is given by $ \\ket{\\psi(\\tau)} = e^{-H\\tau}\\ket{\\psi(\\tau)} $,\nThis transfomration makes it easier to find the ground state of the system. As $\\tau \\rightarrow \\infty$, the state of the system converges to the ground state of the system. $$ \\begin{equation} \\lim_{\\tau \\rightarrow \\infty} \\ket{\\psi(\\tau)} = \\ket{E_0} \\end{equation} $$ where $\\vert E_0\\rangle$ is the ground state of $H$.\nTheory Measurement operators The strategy is to construct measurement operators which take the form of the exponentiated hamiltonian in equation 2. This can be achieved by performing a weak measurement of $H$. Consider a n-qubit system with an ancilla qubit a which will be used for the weak measurement via the hamiltonian of $H \\otimes Y$. The ancilla qubit is initially prepared in state $\\ket{+}$. Performing time evolution for $\\epsilon$ time we have:\n$$ \\begin{align*} e^{-i \\epsilon H \\otimes Y} \\ket{\\psi(0)} \\ket{+}_a =\u0026amp; \\sum_n \\bra{E_n}\\ket{\\psi_0} \\ket{E_n} e^{-i \\epsilon E_n Y} \\ket{+}_a \\\\ =\u0026amp; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\sum_n \\bra{E_n}\\ket{\\psi_0} \\ket{E_n} \\Bigl[ (\\cos E_n \\epsilon - \\sin E_n \\epsilon)\\ket{0}_a \\\\ \u0026amp; (\\cos E_n \\epsilon + \\sin E_n \\epsilon)\\ket{1}_a \\Bigr] \\end{align*} $$\nUsing the projector operator $\\ket{0}\\bra{0}$ on the ancilla qubit, we get\n$$ \\begin{equation} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\sum_n \\bra{E_n}\\ket{\\psi_0} (\\cos E_n \\epsilon - \\sin E_n \\epsilon)\\ket{E_n}\\ket{0}_a \\approx \\frac{e^{-\\epsilon H}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{\\psi_0}\\ket{0} \\end{equation} $$\nwhile $\\ket{1}\\bra{1}$ gives\n$$ \\begin{equation} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\sum_n \\bra{E_n}\\ket{\\psi_0} (\\cos E_n \\epsilon + \\sin E_n \\epsilon)\\ket{E_n}\\ket{1}_a \\approx \\frac{e^{\\epsilon H}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{\\psi_0}\\ket{0} \\end{equation} $$\nSo the measurement operators are\n$$ \\begin{align} M_0 =\u0026amp; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\sum_n (\\cos E_n \\epsilon - \\sin E_n \\epsilon)\\ket{E_n}\\bra{E_n} \\approx \\frac{e^{-\\epsilon H}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ M_1 =\u0026amp; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\sum_n (\\cos E_n \\epsilon + \\sin E_n \\epsilon)\\ket{E_n}\\bra{E_n} \\approx \\frac{e^{\\epsilon H}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{align} $$\nWe can see that the above two equations takes the form of the exponentiated operator in equation 2. The exponential approximation is valid when $||\\epsilon H|| \\ll 1$.\nAmplification of ground state Upon measurement of the ancilla qubit we get can a 0 or 1. Consider a particular measurement sequence where there are $k_0$ counts of 0 (i.e. $M_0$ is the measurement operator) and $k_1$ counts of 1 (i.e. $M_1$ is the measurement operator. Since $[M_0, M_1] = 0$, the order of outcomes does not matter and therefore we can write\n$$ \\begin{equation} M_0^{k_0}M_1^{k_1} = \\sum_nA_{k_0k_1}(\\epsilon E_n) \\bra{E_n}\\ket{\\psi_0}\\ket{E_n} \\end{equation} $$\nwhere the amplitude function is defined as\n$$ \\begin{equation} A_{k_0k_1} = \\frac{(\\cos x - \\sin x)^{k0}(\\cos x - \\sin x)^{k_1}}{\\sqrt{2^{k_0 + k_1}}} \\end{equation} $$\nThe amplitude function takes a gaussian form for large number of measurements in the range $-\\pi/4 \\leq x \\leq \\pi/4$ and the peak occurs at\n$$ \\begin{equation} x_{k_0k_1}^{max} = \\frac{1}{2}\\arcsin \\left( \\frac{k_0 - k_1}{k_0 + k_1} \\right) \\end{equation} $$\nFor large measurements a collapse of energy basis occurs and the ground state energy can be estimated from $x_{k_0k_1}^{max} \\approx \\epsilon E_0$, we can approximate the equation \\ref{eq:seq} to $e^{-\\epsilon(k_0 - k_1)H}$ from the exponential approximation of the equations \\ref{eq:m0} and \\ref{eq:m1}. From the figure we can see that this exponential approximates only one side of the gaussian and therefore for random outcomes of $k_0, k_1$, the sequence may not result in amplification of ground state. If the gaussian peak are to the left of ground state, the measurements sequence will produce the desired value of $A_{k_0k_1}$ which will enhance the ground state. To be precise, if $x_{k_0k_1}^{max} \u0026lt; \\epsilon (E_0 + E_1)/2$ for any outcome of measurement, then it will have an amplifying effect towards the ground state.\nMethodology The strategy is the adjust the peak position of the gaussian near the ground state. The idea is to apply unitary operations conditioned on the measuremnet outcomes. Using a energy threshold $E_{th}$, if the peak is below the threshold then no operation is applied otherwise a corrective unitary is applied. This is peformed iteratively:\n$$ \\begin{equation} \\ket{\\psi_{t+1}} = \\frac{U_{k_0^{(t+1)}k_1^{(t+1)}}M_n\\ket{\\psi_t}}{\\sqrt{\\bra{{\\psi_t}}|{M_n^{\\dag}M_n}\\ket{\\psi_t}}} \\end{equation} $$\nwhere $n\\in {0,1}$ and\n$$ \\begin{equation} U_{k_0k_1} = \\begin{cases} I \u0026amp;\\quad\\text{if} ~ x_{k_0k_1}^{max} \u0026lt; \\epsilon E_{th} \\\\ U_c \u0026amp;\\quad\\text{otherwise.} \\ \\end{cases} \\end{equation} $$\nand $$ \\begin{equation} k_m^{(t+1)} = \\begin{cases} k_m^{(t)} + \\delta_{mn} \u0026amp;\\quad\\text{if} ~ x_{(k_0^{(t)} + \\delta_{0n})(k_0^{(t)} + \\delta_{1n})}^{max} \u0026lt; \\epsilon E_{th} \\\\ 0 \u0026amp;\\quad\\text{otherwise.} \\ \\end{cases} \\end{equation} $$\nFor ensuring the convergence over iterations to the ground state, $|\\bra{E_n}U_c\\ket{E_m}| \u0026gt; 0, \\forall n,m$ which can be satisfied with a random unitary matrix. The authors considered random intial states and corrective unitary, however a sophisticated choice of initial state and corrective unitary can be made to improve the convergence rate. The code explains the examples shown in the paper in detail.\nReferences Mao,\u0026#32; Chaudhary,\u0026#32; Kondappan,\u0026#32; Shi,\u0026#32; Ilo-Okeke,\u0026#32; Ivannikov\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Byrnes (2022) Mao,\u0026#32; Y.,\u0026#32; Chaudhary,\u0026#32; M.,\u0026#32; Kondappan,\u0026#32; M.,\u0026#32; Shi,\u0026#32; J.,\u0026#32; Ilo-Okeke,\u0026#32; E.,\u0026#32; Ivannikov,\u0026#32; V.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Byrnes,\u0026#32; T. \u0026#32; (2022). \u0026#32; Deterministic measurement-based imaginary time evolution. https://doi.org/0.48550/arXiv.2202.09100 ","permalink":"https://gopal-dahale.github.io/ILearnQuantum/posts/dmbite/dmbite/","summary":"Paper: ( Citation: Mao,\u0026#32;Chaudhary \u0026amp; al.,\u0026#32;2022 Mao,\u0026#32; Y.,\u0026#32; Chaudhary,\u0026#32; M.,\u0026#32; Kondappan,\u0026#32; M.,\u0026#32; Shi,\u0026#32; J.,\u0026#32; Ilo-Okeke,\u0026#32; E.,\u0026#32; Ivannikov,\u0026#32; V.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Byrnes,\u0026#32; T. \u0026#32; (2022). \u0026#32; Deterministic measurement-based imaginary time evolution. https://doi.org/0.48550/arXiv.2202.09100 ) Imaginary time evolution (ITE) ITE is a technique to find the ground state of a system where the time t is replaced by imagainary time $i\\tau$.
